# jOOQ sample
Sample project for jOOQ testing.

The project contains all the setup needed for spring boot, jOOQ, test code generation and 
thus makes it easier to start with jOOQ using Spring.

Project uses:
* spring boot - https://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/
* liquibase - http://www.liquibase.org/
* postgres database - for main source code - https://www.postgresql.org/
* H2 - for tests

Project sets up logging to minimum, to see SQL's generated by jOOQ.

# Postgres database

To quickly run postgres database execute run postgres container defined in docker-compose.yaml.

You need docker-compose - https://docs.docker.com/compose/gettingstarted/

```bash
$ docker-compose up -d
```

# jOOQ model re-generation

jOOQ model is stored in _gensrc_ directory.

After change in database tables one have to re-generate jOOQ model.

To re-generate jOOQ model:

```bash
$ mvn liquibase:update
$ rm -rf gensrc
$ mvn clean generate-sources -Pjooq-generate
```

Afterwards one have to manually add/remove jOOQ model files to git.

# Sample code

Sample code using jOOQ is placed in class pl.jdata.samples.jooqsample.JooqUsageSample
